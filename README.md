# Talabat-Data-Engineering-Pipeline
This project shows a simple end-to-end data pipeline inspired by how Talabat probably works in real life. It explains how a big food delivery app collects tons of data (orders, locations, drivers, restaurants, customers) and uses it super fast to match orders, show ETAs, suggest food, run offers, and help the company grow.
